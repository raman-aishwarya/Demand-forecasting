# Demand-forecasting
Demand forecasting is a key component of every growing online business. Without proper demand forecasting processes in place, it can be nearly impossible to have the right amount of stock on hand at any given time. A food delivery service has to deal with a lot of perishable raw materials which makes it all the more important for such a company to accurately forecast daily and weekly demand. 
The problem of predicting number of orders for food demand is solved using Linear Regression model. EDA consisted of removing unwanted variables, checking outliers and replacing outliers with upper whisker(right tailed). Cross validation is done and the linear regression model is built on training data. The model built was checked for multicollinearity and autocorrelation. Prediction was done on testing data and RMSE of training and testing data were very near.
Random forest algorithm was also implemented which gave an RMSE lesser than Linear regression model.
